This package adds Cistercian numerals to LaTeX. The glyphs are created with PGF,
but cashed inside boxes to get better performance.

The package provides (among other macros) the commands:

- `\cistercian{<counter>}` to format a LaTeX2e counter
- `\cisterciannum{<integer>}` to format the `<integer>` handed in as a string

It supports the LaTeX typical syntax `\pagenumbering{cistercian}` as well.
